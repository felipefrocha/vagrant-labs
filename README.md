# Vagrant Labs

## Objective
The main goal is to play around with Vagrant to explore real workflows and 
simulate real workloads with differents kinds of tools.

## Methods
All the provision or at least most of it will be done with Ansible. This will
simulate better ways of manages your real configuration and start with simple
configurations with simple apps and move to more complex enviroments. In doing 
so we will get a strong skill set for devops day by day.

### Main tools for now

* Ansible
* Make
* Packer
* Vagrant

Any suggestion please feel free to contribute. 

## Requirements 

**OS: Most of our applications will be done at Ubuntu or Debian like systems**
* Linux systems - Ubuntu was used to develop every single workload, so once again feel free to add more
* At least 8GB of RAM an 2-4 cores, this will assure that you can do almost everything of what I will present here

## Procedures
If you wanna just play along check in every folder if there is a Makefile, if there is you can check what you can do by hit `make help`
If not, wait for a newer version or one more time contribute :smile:
